# musee - Music Sharing Platform

*musee* is a social media that allows users to send music recommendations to others. With *musee*, you can connect with your friends, send them your music (anonymously if you desire), and pin your current favorite song on your profile. 

We implement **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect** authentication protocols to authorize and secure users' data. Besides, we use the following languages and tools to develop *musee*: **React, Node.js, MongoDB, Spotify API,..** Potentially, we will leverage machine learning algorithms to suggest similar songs to users' favorites.
